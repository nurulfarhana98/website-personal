<p> <center> One of my strength is that I can adapt with the changes in new environment in a short time. Plus, I am a friendly person so when I met new people I did not have problem to approach them first. Hence, since I have graduated in Public Administration so I am quite familiar with the executive, legislation and judiciary of our country. Next, I can work and function better when I am in group because I like to learn new things by changing and sharing new ideas with my friends. I like learning new things because I know that one day it will give many benefits for me. </center>
